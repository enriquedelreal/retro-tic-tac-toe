Congratulations! Your retro games website is now ready for monetization with subscriptions and referrals!

## 🎯 What's Been Added

### ✅ Complete Features
- **User Authentication**: Registration, login, session management
- **Subscription System**: Monthly ($5) and Yearly ($50) plans  
- **Referral Program**: Users get 1 free week for each successful referral
- **Access Control**: Games are locked behind subscription paywall
- **User Dashboard**: Subscription status, referral stats, account management
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe-ready with demo mode

## 🚀 How to Test Your New System

### 1. **Demo Mode Testing**
Your site is currently running in demo mode - perfect for testing!

1. Open your website in a browser
2. Try clicking on any game - you'll be prompted to register/login
3. Register a new account with any email/password
4. Try the subscription flow - it will simulate payment processing
5. Test the referral system by sharing your referral link

### 2. **Testing the Referral System**
1. Register an account and note your referral code
2. Open a new private/incognito browser window
3. Visit your site with the referral URL: `your-site.com?ref=YOUR_CODE`
4. Register a new account - the first user should get 1 free week added

## 💳 Setting Up Real Payments (Stripe)

### Step 1: Create a Stripe Account
1. Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and sign up
2. Complete your account verification
3. Get your API keys from the Dashboard

### Step 2: Configure Stripe Keys
1. Open `stripe-integration.js`
2. Replace `'pk_test_your_stripe_key_here'` with your actual Stripe publishable key
3. For production, also update your secret key on your backend

### Step 3: Set Up Stripe Products
In your Stripe dashboard, create:
- **Monthly Plan**: $5/month recurring
- **Yearly Plan**: $50/year recurring  
- Note the price IDs for your backend integration

### Step 4: Backend Integration (Optional but Recommended)
The current system uses localStorage for demo purposes. For production:

1. Set up a backend server (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)
2. Create a database to store user accounts and subscriptions
3. Implement the backend endpoint shown in `stripe-integration.js`
4. Update the authentication system to use your backend APIs
